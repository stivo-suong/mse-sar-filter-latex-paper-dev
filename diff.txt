< SAR speckle phenomena is explained as the interference of many coherent but dephased back-scaterring components, each reflecting from different and distributed elementary scaterers \cite{Oliver_ProcIEEE_1963, Leith_ProcIEEE_1971}. These interference can be considered as a random walk on the 2D complex plane \cite{Goodman_JOptSocAm_76}.

< 
< \begin{eqnarray}
< pdf(V_{L^I}) &=& 
< 	\ln2 \frac{ 2^{\sqrt{V_{L^I}}}}{\sqrt{V_{L^I}} \left( 1+2^{\sqrt{V_{L^I}}} \right)^2} \\

< It could be seen that, in the log-transformed domain, not only the expected mean of observable variance is constant, the sampling distribution of this random variable is independent of $\sigma$. 
< We have seen this analytically for two sample variances.

< \subsection{ Estimating ENL from MSE index in homogeneous areas }
< 
< Next we shows that the variance in log-transformed domain is equationally related to the universal ENL index. 
< %Variance computation is theoretically given by Hoek and Xie.
< %We show the computation can be simplified as in the confirmation report.
< %Thus given an known homogeneous area, the log-variance can be computed and the ENL can be evaluated as ...
< %We repeat the experiment in the confirmation report to confirm the agreement between theoretical analysis and experimental results. 
< Over homogeneous area, the ground-truth is unchanged, i.e. $X^L_i=X^L \forall i$.
< Assuming the filters are unbiased, or the bias is already compensated, i.e. $E(Y^L)=X^L$, then the MSE becomes $\Psi = \frac{ \sum^N_{i=1}{ (Y^L_i - E(Y^L)) } }{N} = var(Y^L)$.
< That is, for known homogeneous scenes, MSE can be estimated as the observable variance of the filtered output in log-transformed domain.
< 
< Let us consider the speckle suppression effect of multi-look processing in the log-transformed domain. 
< Since multi-look processing is unbiased, we will take the variance of log-transformed multi-look processing output as the MSE performance index. 
< Hoek \cite{Hoekman_1991_TGRS} and Xie \cite{Xie_2002_TGRS} have given the variance for L-look log-transformed random variable as: $var(Y^L)= \frac{1}{\ln^2(2)} \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6} - \sum^{L-1}_{i=1}{\frac{1}{i^2}} \right)$.
< 
< Next we will be showing that the ENL, i.e. L, can be estimated from a given $var(Y^L)$. 
< Taking results of the Euler proof for the Basel problem we have $\frac{\pi^2}{6} = \sum^{\infty}_{i=1}{ \frac{1}{i^2} } $, then $\Psi= \frac{1}{\ln^2(2)} \left( \sum^{\infty}_{i=L}{ \frac{1}{i^2} } \right) $.
< Noting that $ \frac{1}{i} - \frac{1}{i+1} = \frac{1}{i(i+1)} < \frac{1}{i^2} < \frac{1}{i(i-1)} = \frac{1}{i-1} - \frac{1}{i}$, then $ \frac{1}{L} - \frac{1}{\infty} < \sum^{\infty}_{i=L}{ \frac{1}{i^2} }  < \frac{1}{L-1} - \frac{1}{\infty} $.
< In fact, we could estimate:
< \begin{equation}
<   \Psi = \frac{1}{(L-0.5) \ln^2(2) }
< \label{eqn:perf_index_analytic}
< \end{equation}
< Thus, the Equivalent Number of Look, i.e. L, can be estimated as:
< \begin{equation}
< ENL = \frac{1}{\Psi \ln^2(2)} + 0.5
< \label{eqn:enl_analytic}
< \end{equation}
< 
< To verify the above analysis an experiment is carried out.
< In the experiment, a known $256\times256$ homogeneous area is generated and is corrupted with SAR-speckle PDF. 
< Different multi-look processing filters are repeatedly applied to the patch. 
< The observable variance in log-transformed domain is calculated for each simulation with their mean and variances reported in table \ref{tab:enl_in_log_domain}. 
< The analysis values are calculated from Equation \ref{eqn:perf_index_analytic}, together with estimated ENL from Equation \ref{eqn:enl_analytic}.
< The approximation may not be perfect, but given that ENL is supposed to be an integer, its conclusion is unambigous.

> 
> Next we wish to show that the variance in the log-transformed domain can be mathematically related to the universal ENL index.
> 
> We assume that over homogeneous areas, the ground-truth remains unchanged, i.e. $X^L_i=X^L \forall i$. If a filters is unbiased, or the bias is already compensated for, i.e. $E(Y^L)=X^L$, then the MSE between unfiltered and filtered output becomes:
> 
> \begin{equation}
> \Psi = \frac{ \sum^N_{i=1}{ (Y^L_i - E(Y^L)) } }{N} = var(Y^L)
> \end{equation}
> 
> That is, for known homogeneous scenes, MSE can be estimated as the observable variance of the filtered output in the log-transformed domain.
> 
> Now, let us consider the speckle suppression effect of multi-look processing in the log-transformed domain. 
> First of all, since multi-look processing is unbiased, we will take the variance of the log-transformed multi-look processing output as the MSE performance index. 
> Hoek \cite{Hoekman_1991_TGRS} and Xie \cite{Xie_2002_TGRS} have given the variance for $L$-look log-transformed random variable as: 
> 
> \begin{equation}
> var(Y^L)= \frac{1}{\ln^2(2)} \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6} - \sum^{L-1}_{i=1}{\frac{1}{i^2}} \right)
> \end{equation}
> 
> Next we will be showing that the ENL, i.e. $L$, can be estimated from a given $var(Y^L)$. 
> Taking results of the Euler proof for the Basel problem we have 
> 
> \begin{equation}
> \frac{\pi^2}{6} = \sum^{\infty}_{i=1}{ \frac{1}{i^2} }
> \end{equation},

> \begin{equation}
> \Psi= \frac{1}{\ln^2(2)} \left( \sum^{\infty}_{i=L}{ \frac{1}{i^2} } \right)
> \end{equation}.
> 
> Noting that 
> 
> \begin{equation}
> \frac{1}{i} - \frac{1}{i+1} = \frac{1}{i(i+1)} < \frac{1}{i^2} < \frac{1}{i(i-1)} = \frac{1}{i-1} - \frac{1}{i}
> \end{equation}, 
> 
> then 
> 
> \begin{equation}
> \frac{1}{L} - \frac{1}{\infty} < \sum^{\infty}_{i=L}{ \frac{1}{i^2} }  < \frac{1}{L-1} - \frac{1}{\infty}
> \end{equation}.

> In fact, we could estimate:
> \begin{equation}
>   \Psi = \frac{1}{(L-0.5) \ln^2(2) }
> \label{eqn:perf_index_analytic}
> \end{equation}
> 
> Thus, the Equivalent Number of Looks, i.e. $L$, can be estimated as:
> \begin{equation}
> ENL = \frac{1}{\Psi \ln^2(2)} + 0.5
> \label{eqn:enl_analytic}
> \end{equation}
> 
> Let us demonstrate the above analysis experimentally.
> We shall take a known $256\times256$ homogeneous area and corruptit with SAR-speckle pdf. Different multi-look processing filters are then repeatedly applied to the patch and the observable variance in the log-transformed domain is calculated. 
> For each simulation run, the mean and variance values are reported in table \ref{tab:enl_in_log_domain}. 
> The analysis values are calculated from eqn. \ref{eqn:perf_index_analytic}, together with estimated ENL values from eqn. \ref{eqn:enl_analytic}.
> The approximation may not be perfect, but given that ENL is an integer value, the demonstration is extremely clear: the correspondence between actual ENL and estimated ENL is very close.
