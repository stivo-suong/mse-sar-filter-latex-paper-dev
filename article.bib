  abstract = { Speckle filter performance depends strongly on the speckle and scene
	models used as the basis for filter development. These models implicitly
	incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed
	signals. In this study, the multiplicative and the product speckle
	models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known
	filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard
	to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed.
	This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters:
	the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model
	filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative
	speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene
	characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations
	for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative
	speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context
	of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering.
	It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally
	stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary
	have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for
	the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution
	techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters.
	Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution
	versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed
	for optimum application of these filters in the context of nonstationary

	characteristics such as correlation between channels were not carefully

	must be filtered independently. This rules out current methods of
	polarimetric SAR filtering. To preserve the polarimetric signature,
	each element of the covariance matrix should be filtered in a way
	similar to multilook processing by averaging the covariance matrix
	of neighboring pixels. However, this must be done without the deficiency
	of smearing the edges, which degrades image quality and corrupts
	polarimetric properties. The proposed polarimetric SAR filter uses

abstract={This paper presents the result of a comprehensive evaluation of filters for radar speckle suppression. Seven filters in the Radar Module of Erdas/IMAGINE(R) were evaluated, including the mean filter, the median filter, the Lee-sigma filter, the local region filter, the Lee filter, the Frost filter, and the MAP (maximum a posteriori) filter. The performance of these filters was measured in terms of five criteria: speckle suppression index, edge enhancing index, feature preserving index (for both linear features and point features), image detail preserving coefficient, and speckle image analysis. Visual effect of filtered image and its filter theoretical basis were discussed. The relationship between filter performance and speckle patterns was also examined},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce the homomorphic Gamma-WMAP (wavelet maximum
   a posteriori) filter, a wavelet-based statistical speckle filter
   equivalent to the well known Gamma-MAP filter. We perform a logarithmic
   transformation in order to make the speckle contribution additive and
   statistically independent of the radar cross section. Further, we
   propose to use the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution as a
   statistical model for the wavelet coefficients of both the reflectance
   image and the noise image. We show that the NIG distribution is an
   excellent statistical model for the wavelet coefficients of synthetic
   aperture radar images, and we present a method for estimating the
   parameters. We compare the homomorphic Gamma-WMAP filter with the
   Gamma-MAP filter and and the recently introduced Gamma-WMAP filter,
   which are both based on the same statistical assumptions. The
   homomorphic Gamma-WMAP filter is shown to have better performance with
   regard-to smoothing homogeneous regions. It may in some cases introduce
   a small bias, but in our studies it is always less than that introduced
   by the Gamma-MAP filter. Further, the speckle removed by the homomorphic
   Gamma-WMAP filter has statistics closer to the theoretical model than
   the speckle contribution removed with the other filters.}},

	over k independent samples or looks, introduces an offset dependent
	on the number k only. This offset does not depend on the mean level
	of the signal and therefore is the same for all Rayleigh-fading objects

abstract={A class of fourth-order partial differential equations (PDEs) are proposed to optimize the trade-off between noise removal and edge preservation. The time evolution of these PDEs seeks to minimize a cost functional which is an increasing function of the absolute value of the Laplacian of the image intensity function. Since the Laplacian of an image at a pixel is zero if the image is planar in its neighborhood, these PDEs attempt to remove noise and preserve edges by approximating an observed image with a piecewise planar image. Piecewise planar images look more natural than step images which anisotropic diffusion (second order PDEs) uses to approximate an observed image. So the proposed PDEs are able to avoid the blocky effects widely seen in images processed by anisotropic diffusion, while achieving the degree of noise removal and edge preservation comparable to anisotropic diffusion. Although both approaches seem to be comparable in removing speckles in the observed images, speckles are more visible in images processed by the proposed PDEs, because piecewise planar images are less likely to mask speckles than step images and anisotropic diffusion tends to generate multiple false edges. Speckles can be easily removed by simple algorithms such as the one presented in this paper},
